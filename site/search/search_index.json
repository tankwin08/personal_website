This sparsity is problematic for any method that requires statistical significance.</p> <p>In order to obtain a statistically sound and reliable result, the amount of data needed to support the result often grows exponentially with the dimensionality.</p> <p>Also, organizing and searching data often relies on detecting areas where objects form groups with similar properties; in high dimensional data, however, all objects appear to be sparse and dissimilar in many ways, which prevents common data organization strategies from being efficient.</p> <ol> <li>Occam\u2019s Razor</li> </ol> <p>We want our models to be simple and explainable. We lose explainability when we have a lot of features.</p> <p>3 Noise in the data</p> <p>In real applications, the data are not perfect and always noisy inherently.</p> <p>Commonly used methods for feature selection In summary, there are several commonly used methods to conduct feature selction in data preprocessing.</p> <p>1 Correlation or chi-square</p> <p>Chose the top-n high correlated variables or high chi-squre variables with respective to target variables. The intuition is that if a feature is independent to the target, it will not be useful or uninformative for target classification or regression.</p> <p>2 Stepwise method</p> <p>This is a wrapper based method. The goal of recursive feature elimination (RFE) is to select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller sets of features. First, the estimator is trained on the initial set of features and the importance of each feature is obtained either through a coef_ attribute or through a feature_importances_ attribute. Then, the least important features are pruned from current set of features. That procedure is recursively repeated on the pruned set until the desired number of features to select is eventually reached.</p> <p>3 Lasso - Penalized likelihood</p> <p>LASSO models have been used extensively in high-dimensional model selection problems, that is when the number of IVs \ud835\udc58 by far exceeds the sample size \ud835\udc5b.</p> <p>Regression coefficients estimated by the LASSO are biased by intention, but can have smaller mean squared error (MSE) than conventional estimates. It prefer to have fewer variales with huge contribution to the target.</p> <p>Because of the bias, their interpretation in explanatory or descriptive models is difficult, and confidence intervals based on resampling procedures such as the percentile bootstrap do not reach their claimed nominal level. Another problem with LASSO estimation is its dependence on the scale of the covariates</p> <p>4 PCA</p> <p>PCA is a commonly used as dimension reduction technique by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower-dimensional data while preserving as much of the data\u2019s variation as possible.</p> <p>The advantages of PCA:</p> <p>Removes Correlated Features Improves Algorithm Performance Reduces Overfitting Improves Visualization The things we need to consider before using PCA:</p> <p>Independent variables become less interpretable: Data standardization is must before PCA: pca is affected by scale Information loss 5 Input Perturbation</p> <p>This algorithm was introduced by Breiman in his seminal paper on random forests. Although he presented this algorithm in conjunction with random forests, it is model-independent and appropriate for any supervised learning model.</p> <p>This algorithm, known as the input perturbation algorithm, works by evaluating a trained model\u2019s accuracy with each of the inputs individually shuffled from a data set. Shuffling an input causes it to become useless\u2014effectively removing it from the model. More important inputs will produce a less accurate score when they are removed by shuffling them. This process makes sense, because important features will contribute to the accuracy of the model.</p>"},{"location":"projects/creations/ensemble_models/","title":"Advanced Ensemble Learning Models","text":""},{"location":"projects/creations/ensemble_models/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Developed sophisticated ensemble learning models combining multiple algorithms for improved prediction accuracy and robustness.</p>"},{"location":"projects/creations/ensemble_models/#technologies","title":"Technologies","text":"<ul> <li>Scikit-learn</li> <li>XGBoost</li> <li>LightGBM</li> <li>CatBoost</li> <li>Stacking/Blending techniques</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/creations/ensemble_models/#key-features","title":"Key Features","text":"<ul> <li>Model stacking</li> <li>Cross-validation</li> <li>Feature importance analysis</li> <li>Automated model selection</li> <li>Hyperparameter optimization</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/creations/ensemble_models/#results","title":"Results","text":"<ul> <li>15% accuracy improvement</li> <li>Enhanced model robustness</li> <li>Reduced overfitting</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/creations/intelligent_document_processing_system.md/","title":"Intelligent Document Processing System","text":"<p>Project link</p>"},{"location":"projects/creations/intelligent_document_processing_system.md/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>The Intelligent Document Processing System is a powerful application that leverages cutting-edge generative AI techniques to extract, analyze, and interact with information from various document types.

You can either use these models to extract high quality language features from your text data, or you can fine-tune these models on a specific task (classification, entity recognition, question answering, etc.) with your own data to produce state of the art predictions.</p>"},{"location":"projects/creations/sentimental_analysis/#how-bert-works","title":"How BERT works?","text":"<p>BERT was built on the Transformer, an attention mechanism that learns contextual relations between words (or sub-words) in a text. The attention mechanism was used to extratct information of context of a given words and then encode it in a learned vector. Generally, there are two mechanisms - an encoder that reads the text input and a decoder that produces a prediction for the task.</p> <p>The detailed workings of Transformer are described in a paper by Google. The figure below describe the brief steps of BERT during the traning process.</p> <p>where the model takes a pair of sequences and pools the representation of the first token in the sequence. Note that the original BERT model was trained for a masked language model and next-sentence prediction tasks, which includes layers for language model decoding and classification. These layers will not be used for fine-tuning the sentence pair classification.</p> <p>To help the model distinguish between the two sentences in training, the input is processed in the following way before entering the model:</p> <p>1 A [CLS] token is inserted at the beginning of the first sentence and a [SEP] token is inserted at the end of each sentence. 2 A sentence embedding indicating Sentence A or Sentence B is added to each token. Sentence embeddings are similar in concept to token embeddings with a vocabulary of 2. 3 A positional embedding is added to each token to indicate its position in the sequence. The concept and implementation of positional embedding are presented in the Transformer paper. Why BERT? 1 BERT offers an advantage over models like Word2Vec, because while each word has a fixed representation under Word2Vec regardless of the context within which the word appears, BERT produces word representations that are dynamically informed by the words around them.</p> <p>2 As opposed to directional models, which read the text input sequentially (left-to-right or right-to-left), the Transformer encoder reads the entire sequence of words at once. Therefore it is considered bidirectional, though it would be more accurate to say that it\u2019s non-directional. This characteristic allows the model to learn the context of a word based on all of its surroundings (left and right of the word).</p>"},{"location":"projects/creations/sentimental_analysis/#data","title":"Data","text":"<p>You can go to here to download the data used for the project.</p> <p>The deep learning and machine learning to conduct multi-class classification of text can be found here</p>"},{"location":"projects/creations/sentimental_analysis/#refereence","title":"Refereence","text":"<p>1 BERT Word Embeddings Tutorial</p> <p>2 BERT Explained: State of the art language model for NLP</p>"},{"location":"projects/creations/time_series_analysis/","title":"Time Series Analysis","text":""},{"location":"projects/creations/time_series_analysis/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Implemented advanced time series analysis models for forecasting and anomaly detection in business metrics.</p>"},{"location":"projects/creations/time_series_analysis/#technologies","title":"Technologies","text":"<ul> <li>ARIMA/SARIMA</li> <li>Prophet</li> <li>LSTM</li> <li>Statistical Methods</li> <li>Bayesian Analysis</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/creations/time_series_analysis/#key-features","title":"Key Features","text":"<ul> <li>Multi-step forecasting</li> <li>Seasonality detection</li> <li>Anomaly identification</li> <li>Trend analysis</li> <li>Uncertainty quantification</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/creations/time_series_analysis/#applications","title":"Applications","text":"<ul> <li>Sales forecasting</li> <li>Demand prediction</li> <li>Resource optimization</li> <li>Market trend analysis</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/creations/waveform_processing/","title":"Waveform Processing","text":""},{"location":"projects/creations/waveform_processing/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Advanced signal processing techniques for waveform data analysis and feature extraction.</p>"},{"location":"projects/creations/waveform_processing/#technologies","title":"Technologies","text":"<ul> <li>Signal Processing</li> <li>Python Scientific Stack</li> <li>Machine Learning</li> <li>Statistical Analysis</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/creations/waveform_processing/#key-features","title":"Key Features","text":"<ul> <li>Waveform decomposition</li> <li>Feature extraction</li> <li>Pattern recognition</li> <li>Noise reduction</li> <li>Real-time processing</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/creations/waveform_processing/#applications","title":"Applications","text":"<ul> <li>LiDAR data analysis</li> <li>Acoustic signal processing</li> <li>Sensor data analysis</li> <li>Pattern detection</li> </ul>"}]}
