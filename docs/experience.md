# Experience

## Data Science Manager
**Equinix, remote** |  Jan 2024 - present

**Led enterprise HR bot development**: Design and Enhanced GenAI based UX
through design improvements, integrated Azure AI search, and optimized data
ingestion, driving significant productivity gains and reducing HR support costs.

**Developed EIDP (GenAI-powered document processor)**: Automated extraction,
analysis, summarization, and translation of diverse documents, streamlining
processes across Equinix departments and boosting accuracy and efficiency.

**Built contract health monitoring overhaul**: Leveraged GenAI to conduct contract
analysis and comparison, cutting review time and costs while delivering
actionable insights for risk management.

## Lead ML Engineer/ Lead DS
**Equinix, remote** | Sep 2021 - Dec 2023

**Led B2B Intelligent Price Recommendations**: Built AI/ML-driven pricing models
for renewals and new deals with explainable AI, cutting manual effort, scaling
operations, and increasing user trust & understanding.

**Developed audio-based predictive maintenance system**: Employed ML/ DL(CNN)
to analyze audio data from IBX, enhancing safety by predicting failures, reducing
downtime for improved productivity and customer experience.

**Designed and led sustainability dashboard development**: Utilized ETS time
series models to forecast carbon footprint, delivering insights for emission
reduction targets, supporting climate neutrality commitment

## Senior Data Scientist
**Colaberry/Bayer Crop Science** - St. Louis | July2018 - Agu 2021

**Built automated data pipeline and processing framework**: Developed a
PySpark-based system to process large geospatial data (e.g., Sentinel-2), applying
ML (RF, Bayesian) methods to estimate soil attributes with uncertainty, and
support field operation.

**Enhanced yield prediction with ML and sentiment analysis**: Combined machine
learning and SWIVEL pretrained embeddings to forecast and synchronize crop
yields during the growing season, improving planning accuracy.

**Analyzed GET interactions for crop yield prediction**: Built a framework to
evaluate genetic, environmental, and treatment (e.g., seed rate) effects, enabling
outcome-based pricing insights and crop hybrid optimization.


## Postdoctoral Research Associate
**Texas A&M University** | *Jan 2018 - July 2018*

- Developed validation plan for upcoming ICESat-2 data
- Developed algorithms for waveform LiDAR visualization and R package
- Predicted corn and sorghum yield with UAV-acquired data
