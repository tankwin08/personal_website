## About Me

I am a Senior Data Scientist with 8+ years of experience (both industry and academic) in developing innovative solutions to business problems using quantitative and machine learning models.

I obtained my Ph.D. from Texas A&M University with the major of Applied Statistics and Geo-computation focusing on signal processing, Bayesian and Machine learning.

I specialized in writing for publication, algorithm development, and applying machine learning models to develop analytical solutions using various kinds of data such as time series data, text, geospatial and remote sensing data.
